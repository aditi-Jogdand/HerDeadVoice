            <h2>Abhinav Patel</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="poem">
            <p>In this world of <span class="gray">hypocrisy</span> and <span class="gray">shame</span>,</p>
            <p>She seeks boys who bring her <span class="yellow">fame</span>,</p>
            <p>But what of those who raise their <span class="blue">voice</span>,</p>
            <p>Against injustice and make a <span class="green">choice</span>?</p>
            
            <p>He who truly <span class="green">cares</span> and <span class="green">shows</span>,</p>
            <p><span class="yellow">Sympathy</span> and <span class="aqua">kindness</span> that we <span class="yellow">know</span>,</p>
            <p>Are often left to fade away,</p>
            <p>As she chases the ones who <span class="blue">play</span>.</p>
            
            <p>This wrong thinking, it must be <span class="red">said</span>,</p>
            <p>Is what makes him feel <span class="gray">misled</span>,</p>
            <p><span class="yellow">Fame</span> and <span class="yellow">wealth</span> are all she <span class="blue">sees</span>,</p>
            <p>Not the heart that beats within <span class="green">thee</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He who saves girls from <span class="gray">trafficking</span>,</p>
            <p>Gets no <span class="yellow">love</span> or attention for his <span class="yellow">deserving</span>,</p>
            <p>While those who entertain on screen with fake <span class="red">action</span>,</p>
            <p>Often become the object of her <span class="pink">affection</span>.</p>
            
            <p>The sad truth is that she turned her <span class="blue">eye</span> <span class="gray">blind</span>;</p>
            <p>To him who has a heart so <span class="green">kind</span>,</p>
            <p>And the ones she sees, will continue to <span class="gray">contribute</span>,</p>
            <p>To the <span class="gray">exploitation</span> of girls who are <span class="gray">destitute</span>.</p>
            
            <p>But if we stop chasing <span class="yellow">wealth</span> and <span class="yellow">fame</span>,</p>
            <p>And start valuing his true <span class="green">aim</span>,</p>
            <p>Then maybe we can put an <span class="blue">end</span>;</p>
            <p>To the <span class="red">abuse</span> and the <span class="red">pain</span> that we <span class="gray">intend</span>.</p>
            
            <p>So let us learn to look <span class="pink">inside</span> <span class="blue">soul</span>,</p>
            <p>And see the <span class="yellow">person</span>, not just the <span class="green">pride</span>,</p>
            <p>For it is only then we'll <span class="blue">find</span>;</p>
            <p>A <span class="yellow">love</span> that's <span class="pink">pure</span> and truly <span class="green">kind</span>.</p>
            
            <p>And if she refuses to <span class="blue">marry</span> a <span class="green">boy</span>;</p>
            <p>Who demands <span class="gray">dowry</span> as their <span class="gray">ploys</span>,</p>
            <p>And values him who's <span class="yellow">bright</span>, do <span class="green">social</span> <span class="blue">work</span>,</p>
            <p>Then maybe the <span class="red">abuse</span> will <span class="blue">stop</span> and not <span class="gray">lurk</span>.</p>
            
            <p>In the <span class="green">search</span> for <span class="yellow">love</span>, which <span class="green">boy</span> will she <span class="yellow">choose</span>?</p>
            <p>The one who raises his <span class="blue">voice</span> or <span class="green">shows</span> <span class="pink">sympathy</span> <span class="blue">too</span>?</p>
            <p>But why does her <span class="pink">nature</span> show such <span class="gray">hypocrisy</span>?</p>
            <p>Expecting <span class="green">goodness</span>, yet always falling for those with <span class="yellow">fame</span> and <span class="yellow">money</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Skewed <span class="red">perspective</span> of her <span class="gray">mislead</span> him, causing <span class="blue">wrong</span> <span class="green">choices</span> and</p>
            <p>Much <span class="yellow">noise</span> where they believe <span class="red">exploiting</span> others can be <span class="blue">overlooked</span> with <span class="yellow">fame</span> and</p>
            <p>toys. The <span class="green">world</span> seems to <span class="blue">value</span> those who are <span class="yellow">rich</span> and <span class="yellow">famous</span>,</p>
            <p>A <span class="pink">truth</span> that can't be <span class="gray">denied</span>, no <span class="gray">matter</span> how <span class="gray">outrageous</span>.</p>
            
            <p>It's disheartening to <span class="blue">see</span> his <span class="green">work</span> towards the <span class="yellow">better</span> <span class="green">world</span>;</p>
            <p>gets <span class="yellow">short</span> <span class="gray">area</span> , <span class="yellow">short</span> <span class="gray">term</span> <span class="yellow">love</span> and <span class="yellow">affection</span></p>
            <p>And the <span class="blue">ones</span> who just <span class="green">show</span> <span class="yellow">offs</span> with <span class="yellow">money</span>, <span class="gray">gold</span></p>
            <p>Are <span class="yellow">well</span> <span class="green">known</span> to the <span class="yellow">world</span> for their <span class="gray">fake</span> <span class="red">action</span></p>
            
            <p>When he <span class="blue">hears</span> her <span class="yellow">crave</span> for <span class="yellow">fame</span> and <span class="yellow">wealth</span>,</p>
            <p>He feels like an <span class="blue">outsider</span>, true to <span class="gray">himself</span>.</p>
            <p>Her <span class="yellow">desires</span> seem <span class="red">foreign</span>, to him <span class="blue">unknown</span>,</p>
            <p>He works to <span class="yellow">change</span> the <span class="blue">world</span>, to be <span class="gray">better</span> <span class="gray">known</span></p>
            
            <p>A <span class="gray">world</span> where everyone is <span class="gray">valued</span> for their <span class="blue">true</span> <span class="gray">worth</span>,</p>
            <p>And girls are <span class="blue">seen</span> beyond their </p>
            <p><span class="gray">physical</span> <span class="gray">features</span> from <span class="gray">birth</span>.</p>
            <p>A <span class="gray">world</span> where <span class="yellow">love</span> is not based on <span class="yellow">wealth</span> and <span class="yellow">fame</span>,</p>
            <p>But on <span class="aqua">compassion</span>, <span class="aqua">sincerity</span>, and a <span class="gray">deeper</span> <span class="gray">flame</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Let's create a <span class="gray">society</span> where true <span class="green">heroes</span> are <span class="gray">celebrated</span>,</p>
            <p>And their <span class="green">good</span> <span class="gray">deeds</span> are never <span class="gray">understated</span>.</p>
            <p>Where <span class="yellow">love</span> is not based on <span class="gray">superficial</span> <span class="gray">things</span>,</p>
            <p>But on what truly makes our <span class="gray">hearts</span> <span class="gray">sing</span>.</p>
            
            <p>She <span class="gray">chased</span> <span class="yellow">money</span>, <span class="yellow">fame</span>, and <span class="yellow">charm</span>,</p>
            <p>But <span class="gray">neglect</span> him whose <span class="gray">heart</span> so <span class="green">warm</span>.</p>
            <p>She wants someone who can treat her <span class="gray">right</span>,</p>
            <p>But failed to see who stands up for her <span class="gray">fight</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He tried to be <span class="gray">good</span>, to be <span class="gray">kind</span>,</p>
            <p>But society values <span class="yellow">fame</span> over a <span class="aqua">gentle</span> <span class="gray">mind</span>.</p>
            <p>The world is <span class="gray">cruel</span>, it's hard to <span class="gray">survive</span>,</p>
            <p>So some versions of him turn <span class="blue">wrong</span> just to <span class="gray">thrive</span>.</p>
            
            <p>Her dream of a <span class="gray">prince</span>, a perfect <span class="gray">mate</span>,</p>
            <p>But only sees the <span class="gray">surface</span> and not the <span class="gray">weight</span>.</p>
            <p>She judged them by the <span class="gray">looks</span>, by the <span class="gray">cars</span>,</p>
            <p>And missed the one who would heal their <span class="gray">scars</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He yearns for <span class="yellow">love</span>, for <span class="gray">connection</span>,</p>
            <p>But society values <span class="yellow">wealth</span> over <span class="aqua">affection</span>.</p>
            <p>He worked <span class="gray">hard</span>, he <span class="gray">sacrificed</span>,</p>
            <p>But in the end, he is left with <span class="gray">hollow</span> <span class="gray">eyes</span>.</p>
            
            <p>She craves attention, <span class="gray">validation</span>,</p>
            <p>But forgets the true value of <span class="gray">appreciation</span>.</p>
            <p>She falls for the <span class="blue">player</span>, the <span class="gray">heartless</span> <span class="gray">one</span>,</p>
            <p>And misses the one who would never be <span class="gray">gone</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He strives for <span class="gray">respect</span>, for <span class="gray">honour</span>,</p>
            <p>But society values <span class="gray">power</span> over <span class="gray">valour</span>.</p>
            <p>He fought for <span class="gray">justice</span>, for the <span class="gray">greater</span> <span class="gray">good</span>,</p>
            <p>But in the end, he is <span class="gray">misunderstood</span>.</p>
            
            <p>She wants a <span class="green">hero</span>, a <span class="green">saviour</span>,</p>
            <p>But only sees the <span class="yellow">fame</span> and the <span class="yellow">flavor</span>.</p>
            <p>She ignores the one who's fighting the <span class="blue">war</span>,</p>
            <p>And misses the one who would never <span class="gray">ignore</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He hoped for <span class="gray">understanding</span>, for <span class="aqua">empathy</span>;</p>
            <p>But society values <span class="gray">dominance</span> over <span class="yellow">sympathy</span>,</p>
            <p>He tried to <span class="aqua">listen</span>, to <span class="aqua">comfort</span>, to <span class="aqua">care</span>;</p>
            <p>But in the end, he is left with <span class="gray">despair</span>.</p>
            
            <p>She needs to <span class="blue">change</span>, to open her <span class="gray">eyes</span>,</p>
            <p>To see the <span class="yellow">good</span>, to value the <span class="aqua">wise</span>,</p>
            <p>She must learn to judge by the <span class="gray">heart</span>,</p>
            <p>And not by the <span class="yellow">money</span>, <span class="yellow">fame</span>, or <span class="gray">art</span>.</p>
            
            <p>He needs to <span class="blue">change</span>, to break the <span class="gray">mold</span>,</p>
            <p>To see the value of <span class="yellow">love</span> and <span class="gray">hold</span>.</p>
            <p>He must learn to appreciate the <span class="gray">soul</span>,</p>
            <p>And not just the <span class="gray">power</span>, <span class="yellow">money</span>, or <span class="gray">goal</span>.</p>
