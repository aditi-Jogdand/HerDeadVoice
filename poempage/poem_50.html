        </div>
        <div id="poem">
            <p>Amidst the halls of <span class="gray">learning</span>,</p>
            <p>Where <span class="yellow">knowledge</span>  is meant to flow,</p>
            <p>There lurks a <span class="red">danger</span>, so alarming,</p>
            <p>That many of us simply <span class="brown">don't know.</span></p>
<br>
            <p>It hides in <span class="gray">shadows and in plain sight</span>,</p>
            <p>This <span class="brown">monster</span> that feeds on <span class="red">fear</span>,</p>
            <p>It <span class="yellow">preys</span> on the <span class="pink">innocent</span>, day and night,</p>
            <p>And leaves their <span class="brown">souls in</span> <span class="red">despair</span>.</p>
<br>
            <p>Girls who seek to <span class=" green">learn and grow</span>,</p>
            <p>Are met with <span class="blue">hands</span> that grope and feel,</p>
<br/>
            <p>They're made to <span class="red">suffer</span>  and to <span class="gray">know</span>,</p>
            <p>That <span class="brown">danger</span>  lurks in every steal.</p>
            <p>Their bodies, once <span class="orchid">happy</span> and whole,</p>
            <p>Are marked <span class="yellow">forever</span> by the taint,</p>
            <p>Of hands that sought to take <span class="gray">control</span>,</p>
            <p>And leave them <span class="red">feeling</span> weak and faint.</p>
<br/>
            <p>The horror of these acts so vile,</p>
            <p>Can never be fully <span class="green">described</span> ,</p>
            <p>The pain and <span class="red">fear</span> that they compile,</p>
            <p>Will forever <span class="gray">haunt</span> and <span class="aqua">reside</span> .</p>
<br/>
           
            <p>Silenced and <span class="yellow">violated</span>, tears <span class="yellow">overflow</span>,</p>
            <p>Innocence lost, wounds <span class="brown">deep</span> like a blow,</p>
            <p>Every day's a struggle, <span class="blue">tormented</span> by the past,</p>
            <p>Precious childhood memories, <span class="red">fleeting</span> so fast.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Schools and colleges, where they should be <span class="green">safe</span>,</p>
            <p> <span class="red">Perpetrators</span> among them, lurking without atrace,</p>
            <p>Friends, teachers, students, monsters in <span class="brown">disguise</span>,</p>
            <p>Innocent <span class="orchid">souls</span> corrupted, dreams shattered to the <span class="blue">skies</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p><span class="yellow">Events</span> and <span class="green">seminars</span>, <span class="brown">parties</span> and <span class="red">games</span>,</p>
            <p>Crude hands grab and pinch, fires of <span class="gray">shame</span>,</p>
            <p>Pushed against walls, squeezed in <span class="blue">crowds</span>,</p>
            <p><span class="brown">Glared</span> at indecently, so loud.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The <span class="gray">scars</span> run deep, hurt like <span class="red">wildfire</span>,</p>
            <p>Destroying the soul, the heart, drained of <span class="blue">desire</span>,</p>
            <p>Life will never be the <span class="green">same</span> again,</p>
            <p>But <span class="yellow">hope</span> courses through like oxygen.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Speak up, <span class="blue">don't</span> suffer in silence,</p>
            <p>Let your voice <span class="brown">rise</span> above the violence,</p>
            <p>Take <span class="green">action</span>, raise awareness,</p>
            <p>Empower survivors, foster <span class="red">kindness</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>A single touch can change a <span class="blue">life</span>,</p>
            <p>Spread love, petition for <span class="brown">rights</span>,</p>
            <p>Don't let them feel <span class="red">invisible</span>,</p>
            <p>Join hands, make the breakable <span class="green">invincible</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I hear their whispers as they cry at <span class="yellow">night</span>,</p>
            <p>Echoes through the walls, the fear they try to <span class="blue">disguise</span>.</p>
            <p>Their innocence stolen in the dimness of the <span class="red">light</span>,</p>
            <p>Taken by the ones that should have been <span class="green">kind</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The laughter and chitchat fills the <span class="brown">air</span>,</p>
            <p>Everyone lost in the moment of lively <span class="blue">swirl</span>,</p>
            <p>But the girls who've been abused can't ignore or <span class="red">bear</span>,</p>
            <p>The touch of stolen warmth from every boy and <span class="yellow">girl</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The silent screams echo within their <span class="blue">souls</span>,</p>
            <p>Haunting memories, streams of tears that never <span class="brown">end</span>.</p>
            <p>A body shattered into thousands of tiny broken <span class="red">goals</span>,</p>
            <p>Innocence gone forever, replaced with fear that won't <span class="green">bend</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In classrooms and corridors, girls feel the <span class="yellow">fear</span>,</p>
            <p>Of those who lurk and leer, their intentions <span class="blue">unclear</span>.</p>
            <p>Innocent touches turn to something <span class="red">more</span>,</p>
            <p>And suddenly, they're pinned against the <span class="green">wall</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>I hear their voices, silent <span class="blue">screams</span>,</p>
            <p>The pain they've felt, beyond their <span class="brown">dreams</span>,</p>
            <p>Forced into acts they didn't <span class="green">choose</span>,</p>
            <p>Their innocence stripped, their souls <span class="red">bruised</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>In schools and colleges, they <span class="yellow">roam</span>,</p>
            <p>Unsuspecting of what will come <span class="blue">home</span>,</p>
            <p>Friends and teachers, strangers <span class="red">too</span>,</p>
            <p>Predators who see them as objects, not humans <span class="green">true</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>At events and parties, they <span class="blue">attend</span>,</p>
            <p>Their guard down, they try to <span class="brown">blend</span>,</p>
            <p>But hands reach out, from behind or <span class="red">front</span>,</p>
            <p>Unwanted touches, they bear the <span class="green">brunt</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Someone grabs their boobs, and squeezes <span class="yellow">tight</span>,</p>
            <p>Putting hands under bras, such a <span class="blue">sight</span>,</p>
            <p>On their waist, fingers try to <span class="red">push</span>,</p>
            <p>Intimate parts, such a forceful <span class="green">rush</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Even in public, they aren't <span class="brown">safe</span>,</p>
            <p>Crowded spaces, where hands can <span class="blue">chafe</span>,</p>
            <p>On their thighs, rubs and <span class="red">grabs</span>,</p>
            <p>Assaults that make them feel like <span class="green">crabs</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>Pushed against walls, or into a <span class="yellow">crowd</span>,</p>
            <p>Forced to feel, what they never <span class="blue">allowed</span>,</p>
            <p>Touching intimately, without <span class="red">consent</span>,</p>
            <p>Leaving them scarred, for what they were <span class="green">meant</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>These experiences, they don't <span class="brown">forget</span>,</p>
            <p>In the short term, or long-term, they're <span class="blue">upset</span>,</p>
            <p>Leaving them traumatized, with scars so <span class="red">deep</span>,</p>
            <p>The memories linger, as they try to <span class="green">sleep</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>The teachers who turned a blind <span class="yellow">eye</span>,</p>
            <p>Friends who looked the other <span class="blue">way</span>,</p>
            <p>Voices silenced, silenced to a whisper, no one to <span class="red">reply</span>,</p>
            <p>She believes she's alone in her agony every single <span class="green">day</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>They suffer in silence, feeling <span class="brown">disconnected</span>,</p>
            <p>Ashamed, guilty, and demeaned by the vile <span class="blue">desire</span>,</p>
            <p>Expressing their grievances but most are <span class="red">unaffected</span>,</p>
            <p>Their pain redundant to the rest, ignored, unable to acquire <span class="green">comfort</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But we can hear them, we can see them <span class="yellow">now</span>,</p>
            <p>The pain they carry each time, simply <span class="blue">exists</span>,</p>
            <p>No one's left unheard or <span class="red">unfound</span>,</p>
            <p>It's time for action, to withstand abuse <span class="green">amidst</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>How does it feel, to be violated <span class="brown">so</span>?</p>
            <p>To be touched and groped, where you don't want to <span class="blue">go</span>.</p>
            <p>A sense of helplessness, overwhelms you <span class="red">whole</span>,</p>
            <p>As shame, guilt, and anger take their <span class="green">toll</span>.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>But there's <span class="orchid">hope</span>, for those who've been <span class="yellow">hurt</span>,</p>
            <p>They're not <span class="blue">alone</span>, they don't have to <span class="blue">convert</span>,</p>
            <p>To silence, to shame, to <span class="gray">living</span> in <span class="red">fear</span>,</p>
            <p>They can speak up, and make their voices <span class="aqua">clear</span>.</p>
<br/>
            <p>Let's <span class="pink">create</span> a world, where they feel safe,</p>
            <p>Where they can <span class="blue">dream</span> , and reach their space,</p>
            <p>Where their bodies and minds, are <span class="blue">theirs</span> alone,</p>
            <p>And where <span class="brown">justice</span> is served, for what's been done.</p>
<br/>
            <p>Let's be the change, we want to see,</p>
            <p>And make sure that all, are finally free,</p>
            <p>From the <span class="red">pain</span> and trauma, they've endured,</p>
            <p>And where their voices are finally <span class="aqua">heard</span> .</p>
