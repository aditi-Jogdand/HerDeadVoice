        <div id="poem">
            <p>She was just a child, so <span class="pink">innocent</span> and pure</p>
            <p>But they took <span class="red">advantage</span>, of that she was <span class="blue">sure</span></p>
            <p>It was her own <span class="green">family</span>, who she trusted the most</p>
            <p>But they <span class="red">abused</span> her, and left her feeling <span class="gray">lost</span></p>
            <p>She tried to <span class="yellow">speak up</span>, to tell someone the <span class="aqua">truth</span></p>
            <p>But they blamed <span class="brown">her</span>, said she was being <span class="gray">uncouth</span></p>
            <p>They said she was lying, that it couldn't be <span class="blue">true</span></p>
            <p>And so she <span class="red">suffered</span>, with no one to turn to</p>
            <p>Her body felt <span class="gray">used</span>, like it wasn't her own</p>
            <p>She felt <span class="gray">dirty</span> and <span class="red">ashamed</span>, like she had grown;</p>
            <p>Into something <span class="red">ugly</span>, that no one could <span class="green">love</span></p>
            <p>She felt <span class="blue">trapped</span>, unable to rise above</p>
            <p>But she was <span class="green">strong</span>, despite what they had done</p>
            <p>She refused to be a <span class="red">victim</span>, to be <span class="gray">overcome</span></p>
            <p>By the <span class="red">pain</span> the <span class="gray">sorrow</span>, that they had caused</p>
            <p>She chose to <span class="aqua">rise</span> above it all, and not be <span class="gray">paused</span></p>
            <p>She sought <span class="green">help</span>, from those who believed</p>
            <p>Who listened and supported, and helped her to relieve</p>
            <p>The burden of the <span class="red">trauma</span>, that she had to bear</p>
            <p>She found <span class="yellow">hope</span>, and began to repair</p>
            <p>Her shattered sense of self, and her broken <span class="gray">heart</span></p>
            <p>She learned to <span class="green">love</span> herself, and to never part</p>
            <p>From the <span class="yellow">truth</span> of her worth, as a human being</p>
            <p>No longer a <span class="red">victim</span>, but a <span class="green">survivor</span>, strong and seeing</p>
            <p>That she deserved <span class="green">love</span>, <span class="yellow">respect</span> and <span class="yellow">dignity</span></p>
            <p>And that her past did not define her, or her <span class="gray">destiny</span></p>
            <p>She rose above the <span class="gray">shame</span>, and the <span class="gray">blame</span></p>
            <p>And found <span class="aqua">peace</span>, in her own name</p>
            <p>Let's strike at the <span class="gray">root</span>, which causes such <span class="red">pain</span></p>
            <p>Let us be the <span class="green">change</span>, and never let it happen again</p>
            <p>Her <span class="green">family</span>, who she thought would always be there,</p>
            <p>Are now the ones who cause her <span class="gray">despair</span>,</p>
            <p>Her body, once her temple, now a source of <span class="red">pain</span>,</p>
            <p>And in her <span class="gray">heart</span>, she bears an unending <span class="blue">strain</span>.</p>
            <p>She feels <span class="gray">lost</span>, alone, and violated,</p>
            <p>Wondering how her family could be so <span class="gray">misguided</span>,</p>
            <p>How they could break the sacred bond of <span class="yellow">trust</span>,</p>
            <p>And inflict on her a lifetime of <span class="red">disgust</span>.</p>
            <p>The <span class="red">pain</span> is overwhelming, her tears never ending,</p>
            <p>As she struggles to cope with the unspeakable <span class="orchid">offending</span>,</p>
            <p>Betrayed by the ones who swore to <span class="green">love</span> and care,</p>
            <p>And now she's left with <span class="red">scars</span> that can never be repaired.</p>
            <p>She tries to <span class="gray">forget</span>, to move on and forgive,</p>
            <p>But the memories remain, haunting her as long as she <span class="aqua">lives</span>,</p>
            <p>The <span class="gray">shame</span>, the <span class="gray">guilt</span>, the <span class="gray">fear</span> that they <span class="gray">instilled</span>,</p>
            <p>All because of the <span class="red">evil desires</span> they <span class="blue">fulfilled</span>.</p>
            <p>She's blamed and <span class="gray">shamed</span>, as if it's all her <span class="yellow">fault</span>,</p>
            <p>For the <span class="gray">actions</span> of those who have no <span class="pink">remorse</span> or <span class="green">thought</span>,</p>
            <p>And society judges her, as if she deserves the <span class="red">abuse</span>,</p>
            <p>As if she's the one who chose to be <span class="aqua">misused</span>.</p>
